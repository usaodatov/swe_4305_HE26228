Core Types

RegentKidsLibrary (top-right) is our controller. It holds three maps—staff: Map<String,User>, customers: Map<String,Renter>, and books: Map<String,Book>—and provides all operations (initialize, run, issueBook, returnBook, add/remove book, create/delete staff & customer, listBooks, listStaff, nextId).

Position (bottom-left) is an enum with values ADMIN and STAFF, assigning role levels to users.



Inheritance Hierarchy

User (center-left) is an abstract base class declaring common fields (user_ID, p_word, f_name, l_name, job_role) and an abstract showMenu(RegentKidsLibrary, Scanner).

SuperUser and Staff extend User, inheriting those fields and implementing their own showMenu logic (full vs. limited menu).



Associations

RegentKidsLibrary “manages” many Users, Renters, and Books (solid lines with “many” multiplicities).

Book (right) holds its own data plus rental status (on_shelves, renters_ID, returnDay) and operations (lend(), bringBack()).

Renter (bottom-right) models a customer with fields (user_ID, f_name, l_name, cellNum, bookOnLoan) and getters/setters to track loans.

Books are “rented by” Renters (arrow from Book back to Renter), and customers are maintained in RegentKidsLibrary.
