The run method prompts for user ID and password, validating against the staff HashMap (Foundation Gear). If valid, it directs to showMenu based on user role (Control Gear). For admins (SuperUser), showMenu offers 11 options; for staff (Staff), 4 options (Role Gear). Data flows as follows: Issue Book (issueBook) takes a book ID, checks books HashMap for availability, prompts for customer ID, verifies customers HashMap, updates Book.lend (sets renters_ID, due date via LocalDate), and Renter.setBookOnLoan (Operations Gear). Return Book (returnBook) validates book ID, clears Book.bringBack and Renter.setBookOnLoan. Add Book (addBook) uses nextId to generate an ID, stores a new Book in books. Remove Book (removeBook) deletes from books if available. Create/Delete Staff/Customer (createStaff, deleteStaff, createCustomer, deleteCustomer) manage staff/customers HashMaps, ensuring unique IDs via nextId. List Books/Staff (listBooks, listStaff) display data from HashMaps. The Validation Gear checks inputs/states, outputting errors (e.g., invalid ID). Data flows back to showMenu until the user quits, ensuring modular, secure interactions
