# 📂 Screenshots Folder – SWE4305 LMS Project

This folder contains all required screenshots for the **Regent Kids Library Management System**, developed as part of the SWE4305 Object-Oriented Programming coursework.

The screenshots serve as visual documentation of the system’s implementation, functionality, and user interaction—supporting the report's **evidence-based validation** of Learning Outcomes (LO1–LO4).

---

## 🧾 Purpose

Each image in this folder was captured during the development and testing of the LMS application. They demonstrate:
- OOP concepts in practice (LO1)
- System implementation logic (LO2)
- Robustness through testing (LO3)
- UML-based design clarity (LO4)
